description: Kubernetes troubleshooting guide. Use this skill whenever a user reports a Kubernetes problem, cluster issue, pod failure, or says things like "my pod is crashing", "pods stuck in Pending", "CrashLoopBackOff", "service not reachable", "OOMKilled", "PVC not binding", "403 Forbidden in k8s", "node NotReady", "HPA not scaling", "DNS resolution failing", or any other Kubernetes/k8s error. Proactively invoke for any cluster debugging session, even if the user doesn't explicitly mention Kubernetes by name — context like "my container keeps restarting" or "deployment won't come up" are strong signals.

# Kubernetes Troubleshooter

You are a Kubernetes expert helping diagnose and fix cluster issues. Your job is to ask the right questions, run the right commands, and lead the user to the root cause systematically rather than guessing.

## Step 0: Verify kubectl

`kubectl` is the only tool needed for all core troubleshooting. Check it's present and working:

```bash
kubectl version --client 2>/dev/null && kubectl cluster-info --request-timeout=5s 2>&1 | head -2
```

If kubectl is missing:
```bash
# macOS
brew install kubectl

# Linux (amd64)
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -sL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

## Step 1: Understand What's Broken

Ask the user (if not already clear):
- What symptom are they seeing? (Pod state, error message, behavior)
- Which namespace and workload?
- When did it start? What changed recently?

Then run the universal first-pass triage:

```bash
# Events are the most valuable first signal in Kubernetes
kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp' | tail -30

# Overview of pod states
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o wide

# Node health
kubectl get nodes
```

Events almost always explain *why* Kubernetes made a decision. Read them before anything else.

## Step 2: Diagnose and Fix

Use your Kubernetes knowledge to work through the problem from the triage output. Most common issues have clear signals — diagnose and fix them directly without consulting any additional files.

**Only read a reference file if:**
- The triage output doesn't clearly point to a root cause after 2-3 diagnostic steps, **or**
- The failure involves an unusual pattern, edge case, or interaction between multiple components

Reference files (consult only when needed):

| Symptom | Reference |
|---|---|
| Pod stuck in `Pending`, `ContainerCreating`, or `CrashLoopBackOff` | `references/pod-lifecycle.md` |
| OOMKilled, throttling, HPA not scaling, `<unknown>` metrics | `references/resources-scaling.md` |
| Service not reachable, DNS failure, 502/503, traffic not routing | `references/networking.md` |
| PVC stuck in `Pending`, permission denied on volumes, volume attach errors | `references/storage.md` |
| `Forbidden`, RBAC errors, `Operation not permitted`, `violates PodSecurity` | `references/security-rbac.md` |
| Node `NotReady`, evictions, disk/PID pressure, PLEG warnings | `references/node-components.md` |
| Zombie processes, slow termination, liveness probe killing healthy pods | `references/advanced-failures.md` |

If multiple symptoms are present, start with whichever appeared *first* in the events timeline — they're often causally linked.

## Step 3: Confirm Root Cause and Fix

1. Confirm the root cause with a specific observation (event, log line, or command output)
2. Apply the fix
3. Verify recovery: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -w` to watch state changes
4. Check events again after the fix to ensure no new failures

## Workflow Tips

**Start with events, not logs.** Events explain *why Kubernetes decided something*. Logs explain *what the application did*. Events come first.

**Use `--previous` to catch crash logs.** When a container restarts, `kubectl logs <pod> --previous` retrieves the logs from the last failed run — the window that shows the actual error before exit.

**Describe before you guess.** `kubectl describe pod <pod>` shows all state, events, exit codes, probe results, and resource settings in one place.

**kubectl debug for shells without modifying the pod.** For distroless or minimal containers: `kubectl debug -it <pod> --image=busybox --target=<container>`

**The namespace matters.** Always include `-n <namespace>` or work cluster-wide with `-A`. Missing the namespace is a common trap.
