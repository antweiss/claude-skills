- **Tool Management**: Automatically checks for and installs `kubectl` if missing.
- **Diagnostic Decision Tree**: Guided workflows to quickly move from symptoms to root cause identification.
- **Evidence-Based**: Based on the established patterns found in [The Ultimate Kubernetes Troubleshooting Guide by PerfectScale](https://info.perfectscale.io/kubernetes-troubleshooting-guide).

#### Installation

```
/plugin marketplace add antweiss/claude-skills

```

#### Usage

Once installed, the skill triggers automatically when you describe a Kubernetes problem. Examples:

> "HPA shows `<unknown>` for CPU metrics and isn't scaling"
